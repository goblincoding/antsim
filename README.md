AntSim
======

AntSim was developed for a research project of mine titled: “Utilising swarm intelligence to navigate the shortest route between a known starting and unknown destination position in an unknown, hazardous terrain”.  

In my research, I showed that an application of an ACO algorithm in conjunction with the use of “smart” pheromones consistently found shorter routes between known starting points and unknown destinations in unknown, hazardous terrains than random search could and also that the inclusion of smart pheromones provided better results than simply using ACO without the benefits of the additional information these pheromones provided.

This repo contains all the "back-end" source code for the AntSim simulator and since the complete sim was developed in what will remain a private repository, the goal of this repository is to make those aspects of the sim that I wish to share publicly available in the hope that it may be of use to someone.
